  <p>Hi there! </p>

  <p>My name is <strong>Aayushi Patidar</strong>, and Iâ€™m a passionate and aspiring <strong>Web Developer</strong> currently pursuing a <strong>Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science</strong>. I enjoy creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites, and I am always curious to explore new technologies and improve my skills.</p>

  <p>I have a strong foundation in <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, and C++</strong>, and Iâ€™m constantly working on projects that help me better understand front-end and basic back-end concepts. I love solving problems and turning creative ideas into real, working websites.</p>

  <p>Currently, I am focused on building responsive portfolio websites, mini web apps using JavaScript, and improving my understanding of Git and GitHub for version control. I believe that consistency and curiosity are the keys to mastering web development.</p>

  <p>My short-term goal is to gain hands-on experience through a web development internship where I can learn from real-world challenges and contribute to exciting projects. My long-term goal is to become a skilled <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> and work in a dynamic tech company where I can grow both personally and professionally.</p>

  <p>When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy reading about new tech trends, participating in coding challenges, and watching tutorials to expand my knowledge.</p>
